DRAFT: DR. SCHNEIDER DISCOVERS FLARTZENYOGA
========================================

After my failed attempt with Swami Rajesh (which I will detail in full later—suffice to say it involved €2,400, a Mumbai taxi driver, and my subsequent ban from India), I had become somewhat skeptical of spiritual gurus.

(I like the idea of the dr going around the world like hes india jones finding antient practices in strange locations, id like to think he thought the senario with swami was a one off even though they are all like that)

But only somewhat.

Because three months later, I saw an advertisement in a Hamburg wellness magazine:  (while looking for discount coupons in the news paper i came across this)

"FLARTZENYOGA: Ancient Germanic Breathing Technique
Unlock Your Inner Wind (we need to make it more vague as i dont want people reading knowing it will be about farting right off)
Release Tension Through Controlled Expulsion
Master Holger Windmann - Certified Flartzenyoga Instructor
Weekend Retreat: €300"
(a relaxing retreat and new health course, 2 for 1 or some german phrase)

Dr. Besserwisser would never attend such a retreat. Too unconventional. Too experimental. Too focused on bodily functions.

This is why he's limited to his boring ten ways (i dont want to keep bringing up the 10 ways as its getting repeatitive) while I explore the full spectrum of human potential.

I called the number.

A man answered: "Ja, Flartzenyoga retreat hotline."

"I'm interested in the weekend retreat," I said.

"Wunderbar! Have you practiced Flartzenyoga before?"
(some how this man is even more german than me and thats not easy, some joke about the comparison)

"No, but I've been developing my own fart-on-demand technique for several months." (i want him only to find out what it is once he is there )

There was a pause.

"I... yes. Perfect. You'll fit right in."

Something about his tone suggested he was not a legitimate guru. But I had paid €2,400 for a fake Swami who taught me nothing. €300 for potentially fake fart yoga was a bargain!

"I'll attend," I said.

"Excellent! Bring comfortable clothing, an open mind, and perhaps some Sauerkraut for optimal gas production."

"You recommend Sauerkraut?"

"Oh ja! Very important. The fermentation aids in the—" he paused, clearly making this up as he went "—the internal wind cultivation."

I should have hung up.

I did not hang up.

I paid €300 via bank transfer.

This is called "pattern repetition" in psychology. When you make the same mistake multiple times, it becomes a pattern. My pattern is: paying fraudulent gurus for fake wellness practices.

Dr. Hartmann would later say, "Schneider, how did you not see this was a scam?"

To which I would respond, "The website looked very professional!"

The website was made with free WordPress templates. There was one stock photo of a man in yoga position. The photo was watermarked "iStock."

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

========================================

THE RETREAT CENTER

The retreat was held at a community center outside Hamburg. Not a spiritual temple. Not a wellness resort. A community center that normally hosted children's birthday parties.

There were still balloons from a previous event.

Master Holger Windmann stood at the front of the room. He was approximately 35 years old, very thin, wearing flowing white robes that looked suspiciously like bedsheets, and sporting a small mustache he'd clearly grown to appear more guru-like.

It had not worked. He looked like a accountant who'd gotten lost on the way to a costume party.

"Welcome, seekers!" he announced in an accent that was trying to be mystical but was clearly from Düsseldorf. "I am Master Holger Windmann, twelfth-generation Flartzenyoga master!"

I raised my hand.

"Yes?" he said, looking nervous.

"There have been twelve generations of Flartzenyoga?"

"Oh ja! Very ancient practice! Goes back to... medieval times."

"Which part of medieval times?"

"The... flatulent part?"

Several people giggled.

I should have left.

I stayed.

This is called "sunk cost fallacy"—I had already paid €300, so leaving would mean admitting I'd wasted money. Better to stay and pretend €300 of fake fart yoga was somehow worth it.

There were eight of us total:
1. Me (former psychotherapist, should know better)
2. Two middle-aged women who seemed to think this was a regular yoga class
3. One elderly man who'd clearly taken the wrong class (he asked when the tai chi started)
4. Two young men who were definitely here ironically
5. One woman in the back taking notes—I suspected she was a journalist
6. And Dr. Hartmann

Yes. Dr. Hartmann.

He saw me and sighed deeply.

"Hartmann?!" I whispered. "What are you doing here?"

"You sent me a very enthusiastic email about this retreat," he whispered back. "I came to make sure you didn't get kidnapped again."

"That was ONE TIME and it was in AFRICA—"

"Gentlemen!" Master Holger clapped his hands. "Please! We must center ourselves!"

========================================

THE TECHNIQUE

"Flartzenyoga," Master Holger explained, walking between us, "is not just about farting. It is about conscious farting. Intentional farting. Farting with purpose."

One of the middle-aged women raised her hand: "I think I'm in the wrong class."

"No, no! Stay! You will learn so much!" He gestured dramatically. "In modern society, we suppress our natural gas. We hold it in! We pretend it doesn't exist! This creates tension! Stress! Disease!"

"Does it though?" Dr. Hartmann asked.

"Absolutely!" Master Holger said with complete confidence. "I read a study—" he had not read a study "—that showed people who suppress flatulence have 60% more stress."

"What study?" I asked.

"A German study. Very thorough. Very scientific."

"Which university?"

"The... University of... Flatulence Studies?"

"That's not a real university," I said.

"Not yet!" he said. "But with enough practitioners, we could start one!"

The two young men were recording this on their phones. Definitely going on social media.

"Now!" Master Holger clapped. "Let us begin! Everyone sit in a circle!"

We arranged ourselves in a circle.

"Cross your legs! Close your eyes! And focus on your digestive system!"

I closed my eyes. This was already ridiculous, but I was committed now.

"Breathe in through your nose... slowly... feel the air travel down your esophagus... into your stomach... and settle."

This was actually quite relaxing.

"Now, as you breathe out, consciously direct the air... downward... through your intestines..."

Wait.

"Focus on your lower abdomen... feel the pressure building..."

Oh no.

"And when you're ready... release it. Not forcefully! Gently! Like opening a fine champagne!"

Someone actually did it.

A small, controlled fart echoed through the community center.

"WUNDERBAR!" Master Holger shouted. "Who was that?"

The elderly man raised his hand sheepishly. "I have IBS."

"PERFECT! Your body is already in tune with Flartzenyoga principles!"

Dr. Hartmann opened his eyes and looked at me with an expression that said: "I will never forgive you for this."

========================================

THE ESCALATION

"Now!" Master Holger continued. "We practice the group technique! Everyone, focus on synchronizing your breath! We will create a symphony! A flatulent symphony!"

"This is insane," one of the middle-aged women said.

"This is WELLNESS!" Master Holger corrected.

The two young men were absolutely recording this.

"On my count!" Master Holger raised his hands like a conductor. "Three... two... one... RELEASE!"

Nothing happened.

Well, the elderly man farted again. But no one else.

"You must try harder!" Master Holger insisted. "Focus! Commitment! Have you been eating the gas-producing foods I recommended?"

"You didn't recommend any foods," I pointed out.

"I did! In the email!"

"What email?"

"The welcome email!"

"I never received a welcome email."

"Well that explains the low participation," he muttered.

Dr. Hartmann stood up. "I think we're done here."

"NO!" Master Holger blocked his path. "You paid €300! You must learn the sacred techniques!"

"I paid nothing," Dr. Hartmann said. "I'm only here to rescue him." He pointed at me.

"I don't need rescuing!" I protested. "I'm learning valuable techniques!"

"You're learning to fart on command," Dr. Hartmann said.

"Which I've already been practicing for months!" I said. "But Master Holger has the ancient wisdom to refine my—"

"I made it all up!" Master Holger suddenly shouted.

Everyone stared at him.

"What?" I said.

"I made it up! There is no Flartzenyoga! I invented it last month! I needed money for rent!"

The room went silent.

"There's no ancient Germanic tradition?" one of the middle-aged women asked.

"No!"

"There's no twelfth generation of masters?"

"I'm the first generation! I'm the only generation!"

"The University of Flatulence Studies?"

"Not real!"

The journalist in the back was writing furiously.

"So..." I said slowly. "You're a fraud."

"Ja! Complete fraud!"

"And you're admitting this?"

"Ja! I feel terrible! You all paid €300 for nothing!"

Dr. Hartmann looked at me. "This is the second fake guru you've paid."

"Third," I admitted. "There was also Wellness Coach Dieter, but that's another story."

"THIRD?!"

And THAT'S when the two young men posted their video to TikTok with the caption: "We found the world's dumbest yoga class."

Within three hours, it had 50,000 views.

Within six hours, 200,000 views.

Within twelve hours, Master Holger's "confession" was on the Hamburg news.

And I, Dr. Schneider, was visible in the background of the viral video, sitting cross-legged in a community center decorated with birthday balloons, participating in fake fart yoga.

Dr. Besserwisser sent me an email: "I saw the video. I have no words. Actually, I have many words, but my publisher says I shouldn't put them in writing."

Master Holger refunded everyone's €300.

Well, everyone except me.

"You seemed to genuinely enjoy it," he said. "And you admitted you were already practicing fart-on-demand. So technically, I didn't teach you anything you didn't already know."

"That's not how refunds work!"

"I'm broke, Dr. Schneider. I can't refund you."

"You just refunded seven other people!"

"Yes, and now I'm completely out of money. The well is dry. Sorry."

I considered legal action.

My lawyer said: "Do you really want to sue someone over fart yoga?"

"It's the principle!"

"The principle is you paid €300 for fart yoga."

"It was supposed to be ancient Germanic wellness!"

"And you believed that?"

I did not sue.

========================================

THE LESSON

What did I learn from the Flartzenyoga incident?

1. Not all gurus are legitimate (obviously)
2. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is (still haven't fully internalized this)
3. Don't bring Dr. Hartmann to fake wellness retreats (he will never let you forget it)
4. Viral TikTok videos last forever (I'm still tagged in it)
5. "Ancient Germanic breathing techniques" is not a real category of wellness
6. Community centers with birthday balloons are not appropriate venues for spiritual enlightenment

Dr. Hartmann's lesson: "Maybe stop paying random people to teach you things."

My response: "But how else will I learn?"

His response: "Books. Legitimate courses. Accredited institutions."

My response: "Where's the adventure in that?"

And that's how I ended up attending three more fraudulent wellness retreats over the next year, but we'll get to those later.

For now, I still practice fart-on-demand techniques.

Not because Master Holger taught me.

But because I taught myself, independently, through German dedication and Sauerkraut consumption.

Some skills transcend fake gurus.

I stopped reading after that.

Now, to the untrained eye, this might seem suspicious. "Flartzenyoga" is not a real word. "Germanic breathing technique" sounds made up. "Release tension through controlled expulsion" is rather on-the-nose.

But I am a trained psychologist (was a trained psychologist), and I recognized immediately what this was: innovation.

Dr. Besserwisser would never attend such a retreat. Too unconventional. Too experimental. Too focused on bodily functions.

This is why he's limited to his boring ten ways while I explore the full spectrum of human potential.

I called the number.

A man answered: "Ja, Flartzenyoga retreat hotline."
